This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly experience. Here is a brief description of the key features and components of your project:

### Key Features

1. **Responsive Design:**
     The UI adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
     Utilizes CSS media queries to adjust the layout and elements based on the screen width and orientation.

2. **Seat Layout:**
     Displays a seating chart that represents the layout of the theater.
     Seats are represented as clickable elements (e.g., buttons or divs), styled to indicate different statuses (e.g., available, selected, reserved).

3. **Seat Selection:**
     Users can select and deselect seats by clicking on them.
     Selected seats are visually distinguished from available and reserved seats through CSS styling.

4. **Interactive Feedback:**
     Provides real-time feedback to users as they select or deselect seats, such as updating the total number of seats selected and the total price.
     May include hover effects and animations to enhance the user experience.

5. **Dynamic Data Handling:**
     Utilizes JavaScript to manage the state of seat selection, keeping track of which seats are selected and updating the UI accordingly.
     Can be integrated with a backend system to fetch seat availability and submit reservations.

6. **Accessibility:**
     Ensures that the UI is accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to web accessibility standards.
     May include keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and appropriate ARIA attributes.

### Components
